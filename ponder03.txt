Your Name:

1. In your own words, briefly describe what object-oriented programming means.
     -  Object-oriented programming is programming focusing around using classes and objects, which improves
        modularity and code organization

2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
     -  A class is a template for how an object should behave, whereas an object is an instance of a class, 
        and has all the settings of its class.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
     -  I finally understand how classes work. Other programming courses I've taken in the past were unclear 
        on it

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
     -  On Slack this week, I helped a number of people with their code. For example, Rodolfo earlier this 
        week had a question that I was able to answer about returning more than one variable from a function.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
     -  Classes intrigue me. I would like to learn more.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 3hr
Checkpoint A - 30min
Checkpoint B - 30min
Team Activity - 1hr
Data Structures Homework - 2hr
Prove Assignment - 1hr

If you have other questions or comments for the instructor, please post them to Slack, either in the general 
channel if others can benefit, or as a direct message if the matter is more personal.
